## PCB Layout
On [soilsensor.pdf](PCB/soilsensor.pdf) you can find a interactive 3d pdf with the definitive design layout. All components showed are listed on the [BOM list](PCB/SoilSensorBOM.xlsx), you can find also some datasheet on folder *Datasheets*. All gerber files necessary to produce the final board are on *PCB/Artwork/* : they are divided by layers.
