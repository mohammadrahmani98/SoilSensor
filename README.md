## PCB Layout
On [soilsensor.pdf](PCB/soilsensor.pdf) you can find a interactive 3d pdf with the definitive design layout. All components showed are listed on the [BOM list](PCB/BOM/SoilSensorBOM.xlsx), you can find also some datasheet on folder *Datasheets*. All gerber files necessary to produce the final board are on [PCB/Artwork/SoilSensor.zip](PCB/Artwork/SoilSensor.zip) : they are divided by layers. Also the CPL file is provided on [PCB/CPL/place_txt.txt](PCB/CPL/place_txt.txt).
